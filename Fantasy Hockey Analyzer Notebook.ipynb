    "The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the number of fantasy points that a given player will have in the 2022-2023 season. Different fantasy leagues have different points breakdowns, but my current league has a points breakdown as described in the \"points_dict\" variable in the following code block. For example, each player gets 5 fantasy points for a goal, 3 for an assist, and so on. Of course, this can be changed if a different league has a different points breakdown.\n",

The Moneypuck data contains just about every advanced stat you could think of in a variety of different situations (5-on-5, 5-on-4, etc). However, for the sake of this project we will only use their data that describes a player's output in all of their situations. The only stat we need that can't be calculated using the Moneypuck data is +/-; Rotowire has +/- available, so I'm using that dataset.\n",

    "Section 6: Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions made by all of these models make sense; all of the predicted top players are still some of the top players in the league this year, and many of the predictions match up with predictions made by ESPN. One step that could be done is aggregating the six models together to get an average points prediction, and listing the players that way. Another thing that can be done to improve the models is incorporate injury data; there are some elite players that were injured in some part of the past three years, and their predictions are more pessemistic than other players. Another improvement could be to try and scale for the COVID-shortened 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons. There were many logistical issues that contributed to fewer games and lower scoring in those years, and a scaling of goal/assist values could be beneficial to the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I'm happy with how the models performed. After the 2022-2023 regular season, I will see how well they were able to predict some of the outliers, and I'll use that new data to make a prediction for the 2023-2024 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE 9/8/23\n",
    "\n",
    "I updated the program to make 100 models each for the 6 different combinations of model type and years-scope, for a total of 600 models. I then took the predictions from those 600 models and averaged them out to get a final list of NHL players.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used this list to draft my current fantasy NHL team. While most of the predictions aligned with ESPN's predictions, there were some players whom my model thought were underrated. The most notable example is Shane Pinto, currently of the Ottawa Senators; while ESPN believes he should be ranked near 300th among skaters (low enough where he doesn't have a position rank), my model predicts that he will be a top 80 skater this year. Other notable skaters that my model believes in are Brayden Schenn of the Blues, Ryan Hartman of the Wild, Ty Dellandrea of the Stars, and Mikael Backlund of the Flames. Time will tell if these predictions pan out.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE 10/3/25\n",
    "\n",
    "I have no clue why this didn't update last year. I updated and ran this program last year, I used it to draft my team, and my team made the playoffs but lost in the semifinals. I'm happy with how it performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm updating the program now to draft my team for the 2025-26 season."
